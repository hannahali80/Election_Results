3.	Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

  The election commission can use this script to summarize election results easily and     efficiently. This script can be used for any elections in future without requiring       changing the scripts. The script can be modified to get more information on the         voters by showing who votes by last name, sex, gender etc to understand the             demographic information of the voters. This can take further one step by using total     votes and deduct based on age group to understand the percentile of votes based on       total votes cast.
